Unit 4 Re-factoring Project!
hey danielle made an edit!

Goals
-----

To get a good grade in SE-362.

To refactor old, non-compiling Java code.

To survive using Java.

To rewrite this readme as a haiku.

Challenges
----------

The project we are to refactor does not compile.
We're sure it's all because of this "Zach" guy...

Java is evil, but we'll manage.

This is a lot of information to put into one haiku.
